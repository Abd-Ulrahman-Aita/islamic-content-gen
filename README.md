# Islamic Content Generator 

Welcome to the Islamic Content Generator project! This project utilizes Next.js and OpenAI GPT to generate Islamic content based on user inputs. 

## Overview 

This application is built with Next.js, a React framework, to create an interactive web interface for users to input their preferences and receive dynamically generated Islamic content. The generation process relies on the power of OpenAI GPT, a state-of-the-art language model, to produce authentic and context-aware content. 

## Features 

- **User Input**: Allow users to provide input, such as topics, descriptions, or keywords related to Islamic content.
- **Content Generation**: Utilize OpenAI GPT to generate rich and relevant Islamic content based on user inputs.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Render the dynamically generated content seamlessly within the Next.js application.
